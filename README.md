# LangChain Chatbots (WIP)

## Which Bank
Which Bank is a tool-using retrieval agent, with retrievers built using custom data sources. The chatbot has reasonably valid responses, however, it struggles with retrieving information from two tools for a single prompt.

## Stock Buddy
Stock Buddy is a more advanced form of a tool-using agent, which allows for writing custom code stored in methods that are run upon a call from the agent. The call to a function is controlled using tool descriptions. This can allow for more dynamic data retrieval.

## Next Steps
The aim with Stock Buddy is to create a dynamic tool that is able to provide in-depth information about stocks from the perspective of Islamic Finance. This will require creating additional methods to determine the viability of a stock based on Sharia Law.
